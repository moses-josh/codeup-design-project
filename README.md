Codeup Design Setup/Workflow
Create a new organization (under your profile, righthand tab, select my organizations, create new organization)
Name it based on your team members' names
Invite your teammates and give them the role of "Owner"
Create a new repo within that organization called "codeup-design-project"
Create a readme so your default branch will become "main"
Go to the repo's settings, click "Branches"
Create new rule for the main branch
Check the rule requiring pull requests before pushing to main
Everybody clone pull down the repo
Workflow
Driver checks out from main to new branch (named based on what you are accomplishing)
DO NOT code on main!
Driver codes while passengers navigate. DO NOT let the driver struggle while you aren't looking up solutions
Driver: communicate what you are trying to do verbally. People can't read your thoughts
Passengers: Proactively search for answers so the driver doesn't sit still for too long
Driver is done with feature.
Git add/commit with message
Pushes their branch (NOT MAIN) to the remote (GitHub)
Creates Pull request from their branch into main
Communicate your changes and verbally ask for merge of pull request
You can also create a pull request by clicking the link in your terminal once you push
Teammate(s) approve and merge pull request
EVERYBODY pull down main (even if you aren't driving)
New Driver! (woo! :party-wizard: )
Repeat from step one of workflow!
Helpful advice
Make sure to markup the visual groupings of what you see in the mockups (screenshots in lesson)
You can save those locally if you choose and annotate/draw on them locally or in the zoom
Think about groupings between the mobile/table/desktop and how you can get those together to make sense
What you see IS the way you should probably group elements
Don't worry about colors/images/etc
Get the layout right FIRST, then put the sugar on top
On CSS/Bootstrap - as always, less is more!
Be Kind and Patient to each other. Teamwork is a lot of fun when we work that way!
